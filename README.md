# Strimko-Solver

This was a project that my advisor and I worked on during my undergraduate degree. It is a solver for the game Strimko using propositional logic.

This project and paper was published in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2014 conference journal as an Artificial Intelligence class room assignment for students.
