                        <P>Being meant for undergraduates, this is a
fairly straighforward project. The basic project (without extra
credits) should not take more than a week between assignment and due date.</P>

                        <P>This project allows students to get an
integrated view of logical inference and backtracking search in a
small and manageable problem (Strimko). It also encourages
goal-oriented research into an advanced topic. By avoiding the use of
a black-box SAT solver in the base project, the students get a "look
under the hood" of logical reasoning.</P>

                        <P>Some Strimko puzzles cannot be represented
due to limitations in the GUI. However, the solver (when completed)
will work for all Strimko puzzles. The demo version does
not include backtracking search.</P>

pseudocode as well as less formal instruction into program, and also
follow pseudocode logic to be able to answer questions about
it. Knowledge of Python required.</P>

disjunctions on the GUI, and highlights reduction by resolution,
guesses made for backtracking, etc., to demonstrate inferences
incrementally.</P>
